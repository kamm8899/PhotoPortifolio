        I am a Phtographer enthusiast, starting with Black and White Photography back in 2005. I have I learned the art of Photography with the use with film and a SLR, and have matured using a DSLR. I continue to enjoy film Photography but now get into more of the digital work. I hope you enjoy my Art!
